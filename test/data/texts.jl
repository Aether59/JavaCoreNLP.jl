##Obama inauguration
obama_text = "What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted
beneath them - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so
long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is
too big or too small, but whether it works - whether it helps families find jobs
at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the
answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will
end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account - to
spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day - because
only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.
Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its
power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has
reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control - and
that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success
of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic
Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity
to every willing heart - not out of charity, but because it is the surest route
to our common good."

more than 100,000 travelers abroad after it fell victim to intense competition
for flights to holiday destinations in Spain and Portugal. The failure of Monarch,
the largest British airline to go bust, will affect nearly 900,000 passengers in
total and prompted the country’s biggest peacetime repatriation effort."

long_text = " A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to
the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm too,
for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight
before reaching the narrow pool. On one side of the river the golden
foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan Mountains,
but on the valley side the water is lined with trees- willows fresh
and green with every spring, carrying in their lower leaf junctures
the debris of the winter's flooding; and sycamores with mottled,
white, recumbent limbs and branches that arch over the pool. On the
sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a
lizard makes a great skittering if he runs among them. Rabbits come
out of the brush to sit on the sand in the evening, and the damp flats
are covered with the night tracks of 'coons, and with the spread
pads of dogs from the ranches, and with the split-wedge tracks of deer
that come to drink in the dark.
 There is a path through the willows and among the sycamores, a
path beaten hard by boys coming down from the ranches to swim in the
deep pool, and beaten hard by tramps who come wearily down from the
highway in the evening to jungle-up near water. In front of the low
horizontal limb of a giant sycamore there is an ash pile made by
many fires; the limb is worn smooth by men who have sat on it.

 Evening of a hot day started the little wind to moving among the
leaves. The shade climbed up the hills toward the top. On the sand
banks the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray sculptured stones. And
then from the direction of the state highway came the sound of
footsteps on crisp sycamore leaves. The rabbits hurried noiselessly
for cover. A stilted heron labored up into the air and pounded down
river. For a moment the place was lifeless, and then two men emerged
from the path and came into the opening by the green pool.
 They had walked in single file down the path, and even in the open
one stayed behind the other. Both were dressed in denim trousers and
in denim coats with brass buttons. Both wore black, shapeless hats and
both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders. The first
man was small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp,
strong features. Every part of him was defined: small, strong hands,
slender arms, a thin and bony nose. Behind him walked his opposite,
a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, and wide,
sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging his feet a
little, the way a bear drags his paws. His arms did not swing at his
sides, but hung loosely.
 The first man stopped short in the clearing, and the follower nearly
ran over him. He took off his hat and wiped the sweat-band with his
forefinger and snapped the moisture off. His huge companion dropped
his blankets and flung himself down and drank from the surface of
the green pool; drank with long gulps, snorting into the water like
a horse. The small man stepped nervously beside him."
